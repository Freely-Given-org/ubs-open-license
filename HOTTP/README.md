# Preliminary and Interim Report for the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project 

(© United Bible Societies 1973-1980, 2003-2023)

This is a concise textual analysis of the Old Testament, created by a committee consisting of key Hebrew scholars, in which they discuss a large number of OT passages with text-critical issues. For each passage alternatives are given and the preferred reading is assigned a rating (A, B, C, D).

This is the report that formed the foundation of Barthélemy’s **Critique Textuelle de l’Ancien Testament**.
