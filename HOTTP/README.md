# Preliminary and Interim Report for the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project (HOTTP)

(© United Bible Societies 1973-1980, 2003-2023)

This is a concise textual analysis of the Old Testament, created by a committee consisting of key Hebrew scholars, in which they discuss a large number of OT passages with text-critical issues. For each passage alternatives are given and the preferred reading is assigned a rating (A, B, C, D).

This is the report that formed the foundation of Barthélemy’s **Critique Textuelle de l’Ancien Testament**.

This resource is available in English and French and can be downloaded in XML.

In addition to the main database the repository contains two sets of files in HTML (one in English and one in French) that are based on the introductory materials. One set contains an explanation of the four **ratings** that are used, whereas the other set explains the **factors** involved in textual decisions. Those ratings and factors are marked with letters and numbers in the main database.
