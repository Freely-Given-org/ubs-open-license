# UBS Images 

(Â© United Bible Societies 2023)

This collection contains a metadata file (ubs-release.xml) that has background information about three subcollections of images. This background information, among other things, includes all Scripture references for each images. Scripture references are represented by a 14-digit code BBBCCCVVVSSWWW (B = Book, C = Chapter, V = Verse, S = segment, W = Word).

These are the three sub collections:

* UBS - 85 images, all of which can be found in the included zip file
* PRITZ - 161 images taken by Ray Pritz, all of which can be found in the included zip file
* WEB - 1008 open access images found on the web, the full path of which can be found in the metadata file; because of the high number it turned out impractical to include the images.
