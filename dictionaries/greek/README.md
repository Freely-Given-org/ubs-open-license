# UBS Dictionary of the Greek New Testament 

(© United Bible Societies 2023)

This dictionary is extracted from the Semantic Dictionary of the Greek New Testament (SDGNT; © United Bible Societies 2019) and contains the lexical analysis for each available entry, with definitions, glosses, all Scripture references, and lexical semantic domains. It is a revised and reformatted edition of Johannes Louw’s and Eugene Nida’s Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament Based on Semantic Domains (© United Bible Societies, 1988, 1989), amplified with an exhaustive list of Scripture references for each lexical meaning, which was created and kindly made available by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL). 

This resource is available in the languages English, French, Spanish, and Chinese (both traditional and simplified scripts). Other languages will become available once the localization work has been completed.

The data can be downloaded in either XML or JSON.
