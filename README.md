## Web Image Collection from UBS project MARBLE (Modular Aggregation of Resources on the Bible)

This is a collection of 1000+  images from the world of the Bible. Some of these are from UBS’ and affiliated national Bible Societies’ own archives, whereas many others were gathered from different sources on the internet. These latter images were originally published under a Creative Commons license (different varieties). All will need to carry their original © info when reused. The accompanying XML metadata file contains the details, and links each image to relevant Scripture passages.

## Bible Routes from UBS Project MARBLE 

(© United Bible Societies 2023)

This is a collection of almost 200 files in SVG and GeoJSON formats containing the geographic coordinates of routes linked to Bible stories. These routes can be overlaid on Biblical maps and provide details about journeys made by Biblical figures. These routes are part of a collection of data created for UBS by Dr. Leen Ritmeyer.

## UBS Paratext Parallel Passages Database 

(© United Bible Societies 2023)

This is a database with parallel passages in the Old and New Testament including OT quotes in the NT. The passages have been analyzed in detail and include numberings marking the words that have a more or less exact match in the other passage(s), including those that have a partial match. This database is the main underlying resource for the Parallel Passages tool in Paratext.

## Preliminary and Interim Report for the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project (HOTTP)

(© United Bible Societies 1973-1980, 2003-2023)

This is a concise textual analysis of the Old Testament, created by a committee consisting of key Hebrew scholars, in which they discuss a large number of OT passages with text-critical issues. For each passage alternatives are given and the preferred reading is assigned a rating (A, B, C, D).

This is the report that formed the foundation of Barthélemy’s **Critique Textuelle de l’Ancien Testament**.

This resource is available in English and French and can be downloaded in XML.
